                    <h3>About me</h3>
                        Greetings. I am Hirak Doshi. I hail from the city of Kolkata, West Bengal, India. 
                        During my childhood, I have had the good fortune to be a student of the Sri Sathya Sai Balvikas Programme (<a href="https://sssbalvikas.in/">SSSBV</a>)
                        which has played a significant role in shaping up my personality. I also got an opportunity to explore my musical abilities and
                        found a deep connect with Rabindra sangeet, hindustani classical music. I completed my schooling in Kolkata before I embarked upon the journey towards
                        higher learning at SSSIHL. I have represented my school at various musical fests and competitions.
                        <br><br>
                        As a student, I fell in love with Mathematics right from my school days. Fortunately, I have had good mentors who helped me
                        shape my perspective towards the subject and made me realize that it is much deeper and impactful than applying some formulae and
                        getting answers. Since then, I am an epsilon component in this huge mathematical ocean having completed my Bachelors and Masters in
                        the subject. I am currently pursuing my doctoral research in the field of variational methods for motion estimation.
                        <br><br>
                        This website serves as a platform to share my insights, work experiences and learnings. Join me in my journey of exploration, discovery and growth.
